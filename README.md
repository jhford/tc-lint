# Taskcluster Lint
This is an opinionated tool about how a taskcluster service project should be
setup.  The core opinion is that most services should be set up the same, but

up being their own special snowflake.  Without automation to check conventions,
conventions may as well not exist.

These should be pretty simple to see.  Check some example ones.
